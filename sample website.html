<b>PURPOSE-<br></b>
Name of the website- <u>GREEN PAHAL</u><br>
This website is about a new scrap recycle business and eco-friendly stationery, in which you can schedule a pickup and someone will come to pick up your scrap which will go to recycle plants. 
The website will be having a whole page dedicated to what the business is about and how it is helping the environment and it will include the rates of the scrap materials and a pickup schedule page as well where you can login and schedule a pickup. 
there will be a page of eco-friendly products as well like diaries, paper pencils, pens and other stuff, you can buy add whatever you want to the cart and press order and it will be delivered by the person who will come to pick up the scrap.<br>

<br><b>INSPIRATION-</b><br>
The idea of this website came from my dad's business. I am designing this website for his business that he started a few years back and this website will make his work more organized, easier and every pickup and order will be saved that will make the accounting part easy for him.  
<br> <b>TARGET AUDIENCE- </b> <br>
the main target would be the big societies in the area so that the website can float to as many flats as possible and the local schools, offices as they have more requirement for stationery and have more scrap.
